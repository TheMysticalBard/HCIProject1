## Microwave Problems

This is an image of my microwave at home as well as a gif showing how it is typically used.

As you can see, there are some issues with the design of the microwave. First off, buttons such as "Popcorn" and "Potato" are given more importance than the start button or any of the number buttons, despite their relative lack of use. This makes the interface bulky and unintuitive. When first using a microwave, someone may see the large buttons for a variety of foods and search for the one matching their food. However, the microwave only provides a small sample of options. Secondly, there are some portions of text on the microwave that don't appear as buttons but are, like the number keys, or seem to be buttons but are not in actuality, like the "display on/off" button. Third, none of the buttons have tactile features, so this microwave cannot be used by blind persons. None of the buttons can be felt, and even pressing a button gives the user no tactile clicks. On top of that, there is no braille text or voice option anywhere to be found on the interface. There's an "AM or PM" button that doesn't make much sense. The clock button is important to make sure the clock is set right, but it doesn't need to be where it is, or even on the front panel of the device.

## Microwave Use Patterns

### Common Uses

Some of the most common uses for microwaves are heating things up for short periods of time, reheating leftovers, and using the timer. It is not very often that people defrost items in microwaves, at least not residentially. While "Reheat" buttons are generally trying to achieve what most people use microwaves for, reheating, they fail to be effective most of the time. Having a power option is very effective for reheating as well as defrosting, and most of the people I know say that they use the power setting.

### Common Sequence of Actions

A common sequence is putting the food in, entering the time, and hitting start. Depending on the microwave, entering the time may change. Some microwaves have quick start buttons that start immediately upon pressing them. So if the user needs to cook something for 2 minutes, they simply put the food in and hit the 2 button. Better yet, since most instructions come in increments of 30 seconds, more microwaves are adopting an "Add 30 Sec" button or similar naming that simply adds 30 seconds to the timer. With this, cooking items for various amounts of time is reduced to just 2 simple button presses such as "3" and then "Add 30", instead of a long sequence of  like: "Time Cook", "3", "3", "0", "Start". Both of these methods are still valid on the microwave I have in my apartment, which is nice for people who are used to the old method but still incorporates newer features.

### User Support

The microwave pictured above doesn't do much to help the user understand how to use it, it mostly relies on prior microwave use. A few helpful things are included such as the "on/off" text underneath the "Timer" button as well as the "time/weight" underneath the "Defrost" button. "Express Cook" as a phrase also gives the user a good idea of how to use that feature.

### User Feedback

As I mentioned before, the microwave does not provide any tactile feedback for the user and provides very little in the way of audible feedback. Every button provides the same beep noise, so there is no way to understand what button was pressed by feel or sound alone, the user must have vision of the microwave.

## New Microwave Design

### Design Changes

First, I would like to expand the "Express Cook" options to all of the number buttons. It's just simpler to use that way and removes inconsistency in how the number buttons work. Next, I propose turning the buttons into tactile ones and adding braille to them in order to help with accessibility. I would also propose adding a "Voice" button that helps users know what they have selected, also in the effort of aiding disabled persons. Removing the unnecessary food buttons for things like "Popcorn" and "Potatoes" will improve the space available on the display, draw attention to the right places, and remove confusion, so it is a must as well for any redesign. I will also remove the "AM or PM" button and move the Clock button away from the main buttons used. I will remove the defrost and reheat buttons since they don't even work on this microwave. So the final set of buttons will be the number buttons, the start button, the cancel button, the power level button, the timer button, the clock button, the time cook button, the voice button, and the add 30 seconds button. This is still quite a bit, and I will aim to put the more commonly used buttons nearer to the bottom, where it is easier to reach in most common microwave placements.

### Additional Info and Feedback

The panel for buttons must be roughly 2 inches wide by 4 inches tall. This is a good size that will fit on most microwaves perfectly. I strongly prefer not using a touch screen, as you cannot have as much feedback for blind users to find the buttons and understand what they do. The most accessiblilty you could have is a voiceover function. With physical buttons, the user can feel for the buttons, feel when they click the buttons, and read the buttons through braille.

In order to determine the best button layout, I asked many of the people in my household as well as friends online what buttons they use the most on their microwaves. The vast majority never used defrost or reheat buttons, and primarily use the numbers, start, stop, and the power button. I put the most used buttons close to each other so the user doesn't have to travel as far for typical use and even considered that most people have microwaves on top of counters or higher, so lower buttons are easier to reach since the hands are reaching upwards to get to the microwave.
